# üöÄ Easy Setup Guide for Remote Laboratory

**Welcome!** This guide will help you set up your remote laboratory step-by-step. No technical background needed - just follow along!

## üì¶ What You'll Need

Think of this like a science kit. Here's your shopping list:

### The Main Parts
- **1 ESP32 board** (this is like a tiny computer - about the size of a credit card)
- **1 Breadboard** (a white plastic board with lots of holes for connecting wires)
- **Jumper wires** (colorful wires to connect things together)
- **1 USB cable** (to connect the ESP32 to your computer)

### The Electronic Components
- **Resistors** (small cylinder-shaped components with colored stripes)
  - 1 piece: 10kŒ© resistor (brown-black-orange stripes)
  - 5-10 pieces: Various test resistors (different colored stripes)
- **2 LEDs** (small lights - any color you like)
- **1 Temperature sensor** (LM35 - looks like a small black transistor)
- **1 Light sensor** (LDR - looks like a small circle with a wavy line on top)
- **2 Push buttons** (small switches you can press)
- **Some 220Œ© resistors** (red-red-brown stripes)

Don't worry if you don't know what these do yet - we'll explain as we go!

## üîß Step 1: Setting Up Your Workspace

1. **Find a clean, flat surface** - your desk or kitchen table works great
2. **Make sure you have good lighting** - you'll be looking at small components
3. **Keep your phone nearby** - you might want to take pictures of your setup
4. **Have a notebook ready** - to write down important information

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Meet Your ESP32

The ESP32 is the "brain" of your laboratory. It's like a mini-computer that can:
- Connect to WiFi (like your phone does)
- Read sensors (like a thermometer)
- Control lights
- Talk to your web browser

**First, let's connect it:**
1. Take your USB cable
2. Plug the small end into the ESP32
3. Plug the other end into your computer
4. You should see a small light turn on - that means it's getting power! ‚úÖ

## üîå Step 3: Building Your First Circuit (Resistor Measurement)

Think of this like connecting a simple electrical path. We're going to build what's called a "voltage divider" - don't worry about the fancy name, just follow the steps!

### What We're Building
We want to measure unknown resistors. To do this, we connect a known resistor (10kŒ©) with an unknown resistor and measure the voltage between them.

### Step-by-Step Assembly

**Step 3.1: Place the ESP32**
1. Look at your breadboard - see the gap running down the middle?
2. Place your ESP32 so it sits across this gap
3. The pins (metal legs) should go into the holes on both sides

**Step 3.2: Connect Power**
1. Find the pin labeled "3.3V" on your ESP32
2. Using a red wire, connect this to the red line on your breadboard (this is the "+" power line)
3. Find the pin labeled "GND" on your ESP32  
4. Using a black wire, connect this to the blue line on your breadboard (this is the "-" ground line)

**Step 3.3: Add the Known Resistor**
1. Take your 10kŒ© resistor (brown-black-orange stripes)
2. Put one end in the red power line
3. Put the other end in an empty row - let's call this "Row 15"

**Step 3.4: Connect to ESP32**
1. Find the pin labeled "GPIO34" on your ESP32
2. Using any color wire, connect GPIO34 to the same Row 15 where your resistor is

**Step 3.5: Add Space for Test Resistor**
1. In the same Row 15, add another wire that goes to Row 20
2. From Row 20, connect a wire to the blue ground line
3. Now you have a space in Row 20 where you can plug in resistors to test!

**What you've built:** 3.3V ‚Üí 10kŒ© resistor ‚Üí GPIO34 ‚Üí Test resistor ‚Üí Ground

## üå°Ô∏è Step 4: Adding the Temperature Sensor

The LM35 is like a tiny thermometer that gives electrical signals instead of showing numbers.

**Step 4.1: Identify the LM35**
1. Hold the LM35 with the flat side facing you
2. You'll see 3 metal legs (pins)
3. From left to right, these are: Power, Signal, Ground

**Step 4.2: Connect It**
1. Left pin ‚Üí Red power line (3.3V)
2. Middle pin ‚Üí GPIO35 on the ESP32
3. Right pin ‚Üí Blue ground line

That's it! Your temperature sensor is ready.

## üí° Step 5: Adding LED Control

LEDs are like tiny light bulbs, but they need a resistor to protect them from too much electricity.

**Step 5.1: Prepare the LED**
1. Look at your LED - one leg is longer than the other
2. The long leg is positive (+), short leg is negative (-)

**Step 5.2: Connect It**
1. GPIO2 on ESP32 ‚Üí 220Œ© resistor ‚Üí Long leg of LED
2. Short leg of LED ‚Üí Blue ground line

Now your ESP32 can turn the LED on and off!

## üîÜ Step 6: Adding the Light Sensor

The LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) changes its resistance based on how bright it is.

**Step 6.1: Connect the LDR**
1. One end of LDR ‚Üí Red power line (3.3V)
2. Other end of LDR ‚Üí GPIO32 AND one end of 10kŒ© resistor
3. Other end of 10kŒ© resistor ‚Üí Blue ground line

## üîò Step 7: Adding Push Buttons

These buttons will let you simulate digital logic gates.

**Step 7.1: Connect Button A**
1. One side of button ‚Üí Red power line (3.3V)
2. Other side of button ‚Üí GPIO25

**Step 7.2: Connect Button B**
1. One side of button ‚Üí Red power line (3.3V)  
2. Other side of button ‚Üí GPIO26

**Step 7.3: Add Output LED**
1. GPIO27 ‚Üí 220Œ© resistor ‚Üí Long leg of LED
2. Short leg of LED ‚Üí Blue ground line

## üíª Step 8: Programming Your ESP32

## üÜò Help! Something's Not Working

**Problem: ESP32 won't connect to WiFi**
- Double-check your WiFi name and password
- Make sure you're using a 2.4GHz network (not 5GHz)
- Try moving closer to your WiFi router

**Problem: Web page says "Connection Failed"**
- Make sure you typed the IP address correctly
- Check that your computer and ESP32 are on the same WiFi network
- Try refreshing the web page

**Problem: Measurements seem wrong**
- Check all your wire connections
- Make sure wires are pushed firmly into the breadboard holes
- Verify you're using the right resistor values (check the color codes)

**Problem: Nothing lights up**
- Check that your ESP32 is getting power (USB connected)
- Verify the LED is connected the right way (long leg to positive)
- Make sure you have the 220Œ© resistor in series with the LED
